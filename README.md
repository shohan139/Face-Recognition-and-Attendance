# Face Recognition and Attendance
This is a simple project to recognizes faces based on the dataset that it has and record the entry based on it.
<br><br>

Adam Geitgey has spoken 4 problems in face recognition. They are:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Looking at a picture and finding all the faces in it</li>
  <li>Focusing on each picture and being able to understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person</li>
  <li>Being able to pick out unique features of the faces that can be used to diffentiate from other people</li>
  <li>Comparing the unique features of that face to all the people to determine the person's name</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

In this project a face recognition library developed by Adam Geitgey has been used. Numpy, opencv, face_recognition etc. libraries and HOG method have been used and applied.
